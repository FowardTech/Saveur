// mechanism (this file used to have several dashboard widgets whose data-
// loading useCallbacks fed straight into mount effects with `t` in their own
// dependency arrays — the exact loop that made this matter).

// dark "Sundae" AI-voice-assistant mockup; user explicitly picked the
// second one's STRUCTURE while confirming "layout only, keep light theme"
// when asked — so this adopts that mockup's four structural building
// blocks (a greeting header, a grid of square quick-action tiles, a

//
// This is actually the SECOND redesign of this screen (see git history for

// replaces) — the underlying content is unchanged from that pass (header,
// verify-email banner, Continue Learning/Upcoming Session compact row, then

  // the daily goal check-in sheet, the app-rating prompt, and the ad popup
  // itself — every one of them a real native RN <Modal> (three of the four
  // already `transparent`). None of them has ever known whether one of the
  // OTHERS is already open. A brand new or returning user can easily
  // satisfy two of these conditions at once — when that happens, TWO native
  // Modals end up mounted at the same time, which is a well-documented
  // Android RN failure mode (simultaneous Modals fight over the same native
  // Window for touch dispatch) and matches "loads then freezes, won't
  // scroll, won't dismiss" exactly.
  //
  // This tiny queue makes sure only ONE of the four is ever visible at a
  // time: each overlay "requests" its slot instead of just setting its own
  // visible flag on its own, waits (still queued, not shown) if someone
  // else already holds the slot, and "releases" it on dismiss/submit/close
  // so the next queued one (if any) gets its turn. OVERLAY_PRIORITY governs
  // which queued overlay goes next when a slot frees up with more than one
  // waiting — roughly most-important-first (the one-time tour, then the
  // time-sensitive morning check-in, then the rating ask, then the ad
  // last, since it's the least essential and already the only one of the
  // four with its own deliberate entry delay).
  // 'studentCheckin' added (product request: "check up on [students]
  // regularly until their graduation date") right after the daily
  // check-in slot -- same "time-sensitive, but not as urgent as the
  // one-time tour" reasoning, and since it's weekly (not daily) it should
